                    <p>The bench press is a popular strength training exercise that targets the upper body, primarily working the pectoral muscles (chest), deltoids (shoulders), and triceps (back of the arms). Performed by lying on a bench and pressing a barbell or dumbbells upward from chest level, it helps build muscle mass and upper body strength. The bench press can be adjusted in various ways, such as by changing the incline or using different grips, to emphasize different muscle groups. It is a fundamental exercise in weightlifting and bodybuilding routines, contributing to overall upper body strength and muscular development.</p>

It involves lifting a barbell or dumbbells from the ground to hip level while maintaining a neutral spine. This compound movement enhances overall strength, improves posture, and increases core stability. The deadlift is fundamental for developing lower body power and functional strength, making it a staple in strength training and bodybuilding programs. Proper form is crucial to avoid injury and maximize the benefits of this powerful exercise.</p>
